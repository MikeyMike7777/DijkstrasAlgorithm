# DijkstrasAlgorithm
## Data Structures
This program uses a Graph of Edges to find which computers are able to make the minimum total transmission delay between two computers. This is only if the source computer is a server (denoted by ending in _server) and can connect to every other computer. Input begins with the number of computers. It is followed by that number of lines contatining
<starting computer> <ending computer> <connection length>. This program implements Dijkstra's algorithm for the solution.
